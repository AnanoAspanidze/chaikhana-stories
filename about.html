            <h1>The legacy of Georgia’s <br>
                once-vibrant Jewish communities</h1>
                <p>In this edition, Chai Khana explores the legacy and future of the Jewish community in Georgia. 
                    While the origins of the community are unclear, it is believed that the first Jewish immigrants came to Georgia around 2,600 years ago. Over 20 centuries, the group became well assimilated, and developed a Georgian-Judeo language, known as Kivruli.
                    The community was vibrant and diverse, and numbered an estimated 100,000 before they were granted the right to resettle in Israel. Today, a mere 4,000 remain in Georgia. 
                    In a series of films, features and photo stories, our contributors document the untold stories of generations, such as Roza Tavdidishvili—a social activist who supported women’s education and wrote fairy tales about the Jewish experience—and the first Jewish painter in Georgia. 
                    They also look at the lives of members of the community who have decided to stay in Georgia.
                    This edition is produced with the support of the Israeli Embassy, and was inspired, in part, by Ambassador Ran Gidor’s personal experiences with the Georgian Jewish community in Israel and his close ties with Georgia. 
                    “A proud community, which has existed in Georgia for over two millennia, is gradually dwindling out. That is why I decided to support this fascinating Chai Khana project, which tries to capture—in an original and thought-provoking way—the heritage and memory of Jewish existence in this country,” the ambassador said. “The stories are also designed to shatter once and for all the stereotype of the old, bearded, reclusive Jew and shed light onto the rich, colorful and diverse tapestry of this unique community. I congratulate Chai Khana on their wonderfully evocative work and feel certain you will all enjoy the fruit of this endeavor as much as I have.”</p>
