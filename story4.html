                <h1>Once upon a time:<br> A Jewish history in Georgia</h1>
                <p>At times the life of Roza Tavdidishvili sounds like one of her fairy tales.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="story-content">Her story, like any good tale, starts in a time far away—the end of the 19th century—and includes a strong hero overcoming challenges to help the less fortunate and give a voice to the oppressed. It also includes a hidden treasure, rediscovered years after the hero’s death.<br> Tavdidishvili was born into a Georgian Jewish family in 1886, when Georgia was still part of the Russian Empire. Jewish communities have thrived in Georgia for centuries—2600 years by most counts—and were well assimilated in society during Tavdidishvili’s life.<br> She was, by all accounts, an amazing character. By the time she was 40, Georgia had reestablished its independence and lost it again. Despite limited rights for women during her life, she created a space for herself as a journalist, activist, public figure and writer.<br> For two years, from 1926-1928 Tavdidishvili served as a member of the Kutaisi City Council and the Executive Committee. She headed the Women’s Delegation Club in the Jewish Quarter of the city and helped young Jewish pupils read and write.<br> She also worked tirelessly to promote women’s equality, especially through the right to education and the right to work outside the home.<br> “All her life Roza fought for better educational opportunities and a better future for the Jewish people. That was the reason why she decided to write down everything,” noted her granddaughter, Dodo Chikvashvili.<br> “She was a representative of the generation who thought much about the past, present, and according to it, about the future. It led her to publish an academic paper in 1940; an ethnographic essay about the life of Jewish people living in Kutaisi in olden times. This publication unites stories about the Jewish holidays, about Jewish legends, about folklore, and about proverbs. and .”</p>
